In order to integrate the project with Android Studio you need to create a Native C++ project in Android Studio. When configuring the native project, choose C++ 17 and Android API level 23. Place the source folder and CMakeLists.txt inside the cpp folder. Then edit the build.gradle.kts or build.gradle file by changing android.externalNativeBuild.cmake.version to "3.28.3" and adding android.defaultConfig.externalNativeBuild.cmake.arguments.add("-D PLATFORM_TO_BUILD_FOR=Android"), android.defaultConfig.externalNativeBuild.cmake.targets.add("SocketDataSharingStatic") and android.defaultConfig.externalNativeBuild.cmake.targets.add("SocketDataSharingDynamic").

Built libraries are located inside the build/intermediates/cxx and build/intermediates/stripped_native_libs folders.
